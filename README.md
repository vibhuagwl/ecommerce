# Welcome to JOI Delivery
JOI Delivery is built for real life. For the young professional who gets home late and doesn’t have the energy to cook. For the student with an exam tomorrow and an empty fridge tonight. These aren’t exceptions — they’re everyday moments. That’s why JOI Delivery brings food and groceries to your door, fast, fresh, and right when you need them.

Customers struggle with:

- Cluttered browsing experiences that don’t understand their preferences.
- Limited customization when ordering meals or groceries.
- Unclear order status or delivery timelines.
- Poor payment experience, or failed checkouts.
- Lack of timely feedback channels to report a bad experience or appreciate a good one.

JOI Delivery was built not just as another delivery app, but as a thoughtful, technology-first platform that reimagines how essentials reach customers in the most seamless way.

## Tech Requirements
The project requires Java 25. If you have multiple JVMs on your machine, you might want to
consider using a tool such as [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/) to handle switching between versions.

The project makes use of Gradle and uses the Gradle wrapper, which means you don't need Gradle installed.

### Installing Java

Install java using homeBrew
```console
brew install openjdk@25
```

Installing java on Windows, [refer](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/windows_manual_download.html#xd_co_f=NzA3YTZmNzAtOTEzMS00OWFiLTk2NjUtODg0NjNhMjRhMjkw~)

Other ways to Download and install java, [refer](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/#java25).

#### Verify Java Version Installed
```console
java -version
```

### Useful Gradle commands
#### Build the project
Compiles the project, runs the test and then creates an executable JAR file
```bash
$ ./gradlew build
```

#### Run the application
Run the application which will be listening on port ```8080```.
```bash
$ ./gradlew bootRun
```

Run the application using Java and the executable JAR file produced by the Gradle ```build``` task. The application will be listening on port ```8080```.
```bash
$ java -jar  build/libs/joi-delivery-java.jar
```

#### Run the tests
There are two types of tests, the unit tests and the functional tests. These can be executed as follows.

* Run unit tests only
```bash
$ ./gradlew test
```
* Run both unit and functional tests
```bash
$ ./gradlew check
```
#### List all Gradle tasks
List all the tasks that Gradle can run, such as ```build ``` and ```test```.
